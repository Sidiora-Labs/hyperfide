/*
 * hyperfide help — the command table and the four views drawn from it.
 *
 * HELP is the single source for what hyperfide can do: the grouped overview
 * (`hyperfide`, `hyperfide help`, -h, --help), one command's detail
 * (`hyperfide help <name>`, `hyperfide <name> --help`), every detail at once (--all), the JSON an editor or
 * agent builds menus from (--json), and the `usage:` line main prints on a
 * bad argument (help_usage). Adding a command means adding a row here;
 * tests/integration/43_help.sh fails when main or a subcommand dispatcher
 * answers a name this table does not carry.
 *
 * Contract for the usage field: where another file still prints its own
 * `usage: cg ...` line on a bad argument (spec.c, fleet.c, config.c, ...),
 * the row's usage is that line byte for byte, so the two never disagree;
 * 43_help.sh compares them.
