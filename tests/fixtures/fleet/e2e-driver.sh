# The scripted fleet for 35_fleet_e2e.sh: every role, every failure mode.
#   usage (custom driver): e2e-driver.sh ${PROMPT_FILE} ${TASK} ${ROOT} ${AGENT}
#   E2E_DIR   scratch dir for markers; CG the cg binary
#
# Workers (feature alpha):
#   2.1  fails its first attempt with an error result; the retry does the work,
#        widening its slice to docs/d.md (slice --widen) before it edits it
#   2.2  stalls on its first attempt (sleeps until stopped); the retry changes
#        alpha's signature — the interface change
#   3.2  (wave 2) writes src/d.ts calling alpha and indexes its branch, then
#        waits for 2.2 to merge into wave 1's branch so the change reaches it
#        as drift; edits docs/d.md, which 2.1's retry also edited — the
#        conflict, met when wave 2 lands on a main that carries wave 1
#   beta/2.1 plain work
# Wave managers (one per wave, CG_WAVE): land the wave once its tasks are
#   done, merged up, and every earlier wave has landed; a land that does not
#   merge is resolved on the wave branch by keeping the wave's version.
