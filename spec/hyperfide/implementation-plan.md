# Hyperfide implementation plan

**Approved implementation baseline on 2026-10-16. Per-task states below are historical planning states; native `spec.kvx` owns live bootstrap progress.**

This approved dependency graph contains 113 bounded implementation and qualification packages across 34 waves. It covers all 113 native acceptance clauses. The native KVX task sections are generated from [the versioned planning catalog](evidence/task-catalog.json); the IDs remain stable even when explicitly approved scope or dependency amendments revise the plan. Live native statuses and runtime metadata are never imported from historical catalog states. Each task initially owns one acceptance clause, and its concrete steps integrate the relevant cross-cutting contracts. A task can be implemented before full programme qualification, but its component receipts cannot claim a full acceptance case passed.

The implementation team must re-read the pinned current source and approved architecture at task start. Proposed paths describe intended ownership, including files that do not yet exist; they are not claims about shipped modules. Current source paths named by an integration task are edited only after approval. All builds, prerequisites, indexing, implementation, tests, reproductions, integration and qualification run remotely. The main server receives verified prebuilt outputs and performs supervision.

## How to execute the approved graph

1. Record the user-approved specification revision and unresolved deployment choices through the primary leader; resolve only choices required by the next stage. No authoring task or review receipt grants implementation approval.
2. Begin with task 27.1: use existing approved provider/remote-access tooling to create the first disposable remote workspace, recording its IDs, owner and expiry in a durable bootstrap ledger until the new inventory can adopt it. Bootstrap the fail-closed harness and independent checker there; the future Hyperfide provisioner is not a prerequisite for its own implementation. Its self-tests deliberately observe negative outcomes without requiring absent product components or paid credentials to pass. Task1.4 then applies approved policy/dependency/build boundaries.
3. Assign eligible packages to accountable feature/domain managers; the scheduler validates prerequisite milestones, scope, resource reservations and current authority. Wave numbers derive from the dependency DAG; changing them requires structural validation and cannot weaken dependencies.
4. Implement the exact component and registered assertions. Independent remote verification captures immutable receipts. A task whose implementation is ready but required live capability is unavailable remains unqualified with explicit BLOCKED evidence; its dependants do not silently proceed.
5. Assemble candidates and run full cross-component suites. Component variants are deliberately insufficient for programme qualification. Provider/account/native authentication and endurance claims require actual permitted live evidence.
6. Complete migration/rebrand, stage the live fleet, execute fault/recovery campaigns, close documentation, and reconstruct release readiness independently before production activation.

## Command and assertion contract

Every `verify_cmd` below describes its task verification interface. Actual execution and source-bound receipts are tracked independently; the planning descriptions below are not evidence of execution. `tests/hyperfide/qualify.py --case V-NNN --manifest tests/hyperfide/manifests/tasks/N.M.json` selects a **registered component variant** via the immutable manifest. Each variant declares exact assertion IDs and expected counts; unknown/missing/empty variants, credentials, fixtures, executables and required results fail nonzero. The harness never silently shrinks a V-case or substitutes a simulator for live evidence. A full-case/campaign manifest declares all assertions and provider/connector variants required by the [verification registry](verification.md). Each case selection emits a separate scope-qualified receipt. Task28.3 requires full-case evidence, including obligations that span multiple component tasks. Task28.4 establishes validated traceability before final closure; the checker qualifies itself against controlled packs before it seals the actual candidate inventory, avoiding a receipt that requires itself as an input.

Task27.1 owns core harness/schema/checker/registry files. Task1.4 takes serialized ownership of the evidence checker from task27.1 only to align canonical path ordering across runner and checker; inventory and content validation remain strict, with an actual file-prefix/directory regression. Later tasks add separate case-registration fragments and component probe files under their own paths; the harness discovers fragments deterministically and rejects duplicate/unknown IDs. This avoids concurrent writes to the central case registry. Its bootstrap command runs `selftest_harness.py` first, then the V-056 harness variant; it is meaningful only after those programs are implemented and cannot pass through file-existence checks.

## Ownership and integration seams

Control, provisioner and dispatch services share a pinned TypeScript codebase under `services/hyperfide/`; the compatible CLI and supervisor use C modules under `src/hyperfide/`. Protocol/storage/role records are frozen in task4.1 and expanded through versioned schema changes owned by the relevant component. Task1.4 owns initial package/build policy wiring, task25.3 owns the existing CLI/MCP/hook/editor/orchestrator façade retrofit, and task26.1/26.4 own later branding/generator integration. Task1.4 owns actual service entrypoints and the typed registration/build seams. Every later module owns a separate component fragment and must exercise the linked internal API or runner interface; task25.3 later wires existing public façades.  Shared-source edits outside a task's declared scope need an explicit additional dependency/owner, not an untracked concurrent patch. A new module still requires real entrypoint/build/service wiring and black-box integration evidence; compiling disconnected scaffolding is insufficient.

Each task owns its declared exact paths while active; same-wave overlap is forbidden. Serialized shared paths: services/hyperfide/src/components/registry.ts owned by 1.4 -> 4.2 -> 14.1; services/hyperfide/src/components/service.ts owned by 1.4 -> 14.1; Makefile owned by 1.4 -> 12.1 -> 25.3 -> 26.2; src/hyperfide/components/schema.kvx owned by 1.4 -> 12.1; scripts/hyperfide-native-components.py owned by 1.4 -> 12.1; src/hyperfide/component_main.c owned by 1.4 -> 25.3; src/hyperfide/components.h owned by 1.4 -> 25.3; scripts/install.sh owned by 26.1 -> 26.2; scripts/release.sh owned by 26.1 -> 26.2; src/spec.c owned by 25.3 -> 26.4. Other shared-source edits require explicit serialized ownership and dependencies before work starts.

The JSON catalog contains complete approved task paths, steps, commands, owners and artifact outputs. Scope amendments require one coordinator writer and matching native/catalog structure. Native task statuses and runtime metadata remain authoritative during bootstrap; rendering must preserve them. Ignored generated agent pointers are regenerated through the owning workflow and are not task1.4 tracked commit paths.

## Qualification stages and dependencies

| Stage | Tasks / exit |
|---|---|
| Remote foundations |27.1→1.4→schema/spec/identity/transaction modules; strict negative harness before component work.|
| Distributed core |Primary claims/leases, durable events, scoped packets, replica barriers and provider/runner contracts.|
| Integrated execution |Prepared source, isolated slots, real frontier connectors, artifact receipts, independent assurance and recovery.|
| Semantic/integration |Every-watcher/every-commit coverage, producer-consumer contracts, findings/GitHub, sole Git publication gateway and multi-repository release barrier.|
| Migration and product |Actual SQLite-shape import, single-authority cutover/rollback, old/new CLI/MCP/editor/offline parity and Hyperfide identity.|
| Advisory decisions |Three typed candidate adapters, migrated existing Jev/recap purposes, async fallback, temporally valid evaluation and controlled promotion.|
| Release qualification |27.2 deterministic replay→27.3 real-provider qualification from the Paxeer X v6.12.0 production release run→27.4 combinedfaults→28.3 fullcurrent-evidence closure.|

These stages are workstream explanations; the exact predecessor list below determines scheduling. Campaign numbering S0–S7 in verification.md is independent from implementation wave numbers.

Live provider/model probes are explicit manifest variants. Deterministic contract fixtures qualify only the bounded component behavior they execute. An unavailable credential blocks a required live variant; it never silently selects a simulated variant. Early standalone auth probes precede connector integration, while actual renewal endurance belongs to the live campaign. Task25.2 rehearses cutover/rollback after the naming/client transition, before task27.3 begins expensive fleet endurance.

## Runtime and distribution integration ownership

Task4.2 composes initialized components with a bounded per-process resource container and explicit dependency capabilities. Task14.1 owns the authenticated coordinator HTTPS listener, versioned external protocol and service lifetime independent of stdin. It reuses the established dispatcher and resource container; remote messages cannot choose trusted actor identity, policy or capabilities.

Task12.1 owns the reusable native libcurl/TLS transport and extends the actual component build contract after the foundation. Task25.3 links nested native modules into the real public CLI/MCP entrypoints and reuses that transport. Task26.2 owns canonical executable, installer, release and uninstall integration after their explicit ownership predecessors. Each gate exercises actual process, socket, linked artifact or installed command behavior rather than disconnected helpers.

These are approved implementation assignments for existing requirements, not claims that the future listener, transport or distribution integration already exists. The detailed packets below carry the exact owned paths and dependencies.

## Detailed implementation packets

The catalog is the versioned planning source. Per-task states below describe the initial planning baseline; native KVX owns live bootstrap progress. Paths describe approved task ownership, including future files. Verification commands are interfaces whose actual execution and receipts are tracked separately.

### Task 27.1 — Bootstrap strict qualification harness and independent receipt checker

Planning baseline pending · wave 1 · owner `qualification` · clause `27.1`

Requires: Approval boundary only.

1. Bootstrap the first disposable remote workspace through an existing approved provider SDK/CLI or remote-access tool, before Hyperfide adapters exist. Record resource IDs/credentials references/owner/expiry in a durable bootstrap ledger; edit/build/execute the harness remotely, verify cleanup, and import surviving resources into Hyperfide inventory when available. No bootstrap build or implementation runs on the supervision host.
2. Implement registered case/variant manifests, exact assertion inventories and append-only evidence receipts; bootstrap its own negative self-tests without product/cloud prerequisites.
3. Reject absent or unknown selectors, zero assertions, missing required fixtures/credentials, failed children and unresolved cleanup; self-tests assert these failures rather than treating absence as success.
4. Implement the task's registered positive/negative assertions and immutable manifest; execute them remotely after approval, preserving command, exact revisions, complete artifacts and independent observed outcomes.

Owns: `tests/hyperfide/qualify.py`, `tests/hyperfide/manifests/tasks/27.1.json`, `tests/hyperfide/check-evidence.py`, `tests/hyperfide/registry.json`, `tests/hyperfide/selftest_harness.py`, `tests/hyperfide/manifest.schema.json`, `tests/hyperfide/cases/tasks/27_1.py`, `tests/hyperfide/registrations/27.1.json`, `tests/hyperfide/bootstrap-contract.md`, `tests/hyperfide/test_required_artifact_receipts.py`, `tests/hyperfide/inspect-proof.py`, `tests/hyperfide/test_inspect_proof.py`.

Verification interface:

```sh
python3 tests/hyperfide/selftest_harness.py && python3 tests/hyperfide/qualify.py --case V-056 --manifest tests/hyperfide/manifests/tasks/27.1.json
```

Outputs: `artifacts/hyperfide/tasks/27.1/manifest.json`, `artifacts/hyperfide/tasks/27.1/evidence-index.json`.

Registered task-component variant only; all cases remain UNRUN now. This task receipt cannot replace any required full-case/provider/connector/campaign receipt.

### Task 1.4 — Record approval policy and bootstrap dependency-enabled build boundaries

Planning baseline pending · wave 2 · owner `foundation` · clause `1.4`

Requires: 27.1.

1. Implement approved run-policy revision and inactive/unapproved refusal; supersede the local single-binary/dependency restrictions through their owning workflow source only after user approval.
2. Establish pinned TypeScript/native build inputs and control/provisioner/dispatch process boundaries; prove an unapproved programme cannot activate or dispatch.
3. Create real control/provisioner/dispatch entrypoints and a versioned per-component registration/build contract. Each later module task contributes its own explicit registration fragment and exercises the resulting internal service or runner interface; existing public CLI/MCP/editor wiring is completed by task25.3. Reject duplicate component IDs, unsupported schemas and missing linked modules.
4. Implement the task's registered positive/negative assertions and immutable manifest; execute them remotely after approval, preserving command, exact revisions, complete artifacts and independent observed outcomes.

Owns: `services/hyperfide/src/policy/programme.ts`, `tests/hyperfide/manifests/tasks/1.4.json`, `spec/workflow.kvx`, `Makefile`, `services/hyperfide/package.json`, `services/hyperfide/package-lock.json`, `services/hyperfide/tsconfig.json`, `tests/hyperfide/cases/tasks/1_4.py`, `tests/hyperfide/registrations/1.4.json`, `services/hyperfide/src/control.ts`, `services/hyperfide/src/provisioner.ts`, `services/hyperfide/src/dispatch.ts`, `services/hyperfide/src/components/registry.ts`, `services/hyperfide/components/schema.json`, `src/hyperfide/components/schema.kvx`, `services/hyperfide/src/components/service.ts`, `services/hyperfide/components/1.4.json`, `spec/hyperfide/tools/render_native.py`, `spec/hyperfide/tools/validate_pack.py`, `spec/hyperfide/README.md`, `spec/hyperfide/requirements.md`, `spec/hyperfide/implementation-plan.md`, `spec/hyperfide/traceability.md`, `spec/hyperfide/privacy.md`, `spec/hyperfide/decisions.md`, `spec/hyperfide/evidence/traceability.json`, `scripts/hyperfide-native-components.py`, `src/hyperfide/components.h`, `src/hyperfide/component_main.c`, `spec/hyperfide/spec.kvx`, `spec/hyperfide/evidence/task-catalog.json`, `.gitignore`, `tests/hyperfide/check-evidence.py`, `spec/hyperfide/evidence/implementation-validation.json`.

Verification interface:

```sh

```

Outputs: `artifacts/hyperfide/tasks/1.4/manifest.json`, `artifacts/hyperfide/tasks/1.4/evidence-index.json`.

Registered task-component variant only; all cases remain UNRUN now. This task receipt cannot replace any required full-case/provider/connector/campaign receipt.

### Task 4.1 — Create namespaced PostgreSQL authority schema and API record contracts

Planning baseline pending · wave 3 · owner `storage` · clause `4.1`

Requires: 1.4.

1. Create versioned keys, constraints and records for run/spec/task/attempt/lease/pool/reservation/sandbox/slot/session/graph/finding/evidence/publication entities.
2. Exercise duplicate identities, foreign-run references and invalid source/artifact relationships; preserve Git and object storage as separate payload authorities.
3. Define submitted-result custody as a separate versioned authority record: immutable submission ID, source attempt/generation, custody generation/state and independent qualification outcome. Constrain at most one active custody per task and include requalification and publication-operation records.
4. Register this module through its task-owned component fragment in the established service entrypoint and verify its externally observable internal API behavior; an unreferenced source file or direct function-only test cannot satisfy the component gate.
5. Implement the task's registered positive/negative assertions and immutable manifest; execute them remotely after approval, preserving command, exact revisions, complete artifacts and independent observed outcomes.

Owns: `services/hyperfide/src/storage/schema.ts`, `tests/hyperfide/manifests/tasks/4.1.json`, `services/hyperfide/migrations/0001-authority.sql`, `services/hyperfide/src/contracts/records.ts`, `tests/hyperfide/cases/tasks/4_1.py`, `tests/hyperfide/registrations/4.1.json`, `services/hyperfide/components/4.1.json`.

Verification interface:

```

Outputs: `artifacts/hyperfide/tasks/4.1/manifest.json`, `artifacts/hyperfide/tasks/4.1/evidence-index.json`.

Registered task-component variant only; all cases remain UNRUN now. This task receipt cannot replace any required full-case/provider/connector/campaign receipt.

### Task 8.1 — Define capability-aware provider interface and unsupported outcomes

Planning baseline pending · wave 3 · owner `providers` · clause `8.1`

Requires: 1.4.

1. Define pinned prepare/create/list/observe/attach/execute/stop/transfer/lifetime/destroy interfaces and typed unknown/error outcomes.
2. Validate required capabilities before placement; unsupported stdin/snapshot/network/storage features fail explicitly rather than degrade task requirements.
3. Register this module through its task-owned component fragment in the established service entrypoint and verify its externally observable internal API behavior; an unreferenced source file or direct function-only test cannot satisfy the component gate.
4. Implement the task's registered positive/negative assertions and immutable manifest; execute them remotely after approval, preserving command, exact revisions, complete artifacts and independent observed outcomes.

Owns: `services/hyperfide/src/providers/contract.ts`, `tests/hyperfide/manifests/tasks/8.1.json`, `tests/hyperfide/cases/tasks/8_1.py`, `tests/hyperfide/registrations/8.1.json`, `services/hyperfide/components/8.1.json`.

Verification interface:

```sh
python3 tests/hyperfide/qualify.py --case V-036 --manifest tests/hyperfide/manifests/tasks/8.1.json && python3 tests/hyperfide/qualify.py --case V-041 --manifest tests/hyperfide/manifests/tasks/8.1.json
```

Outputs: `artifacts/hyperfide/tasks/8.1/manifest.json`, `artifacts/hyperfide/tasks/8.1/evidence-index.json`.

Registered task-component variant only; all cases remain UNRUN now. This task receipt cannot replace any required full-case/provider/connector/campaign receipt.

### Task 11.1 — Publish content-derived environment profiles without live identity

Pending · wave 3 · owner `preparation` · clause `11.1`

Requires: 1.4.

1. Pin OS/architecture/toolchains/lock inputs/native CLIs/runner versions and required capabilities in content-derived preparation manifests.
2. Scan designated canary identities/secrets and active leases from candidate bases; changed recipe/toolchain/locks produce a distinct preparation identity.
3. Register this module through its task-owned component fragment in the established service entrypoint and verify its externally observable internal API behavior; an unreferenced source file or direct function-only test cannot satisfy the component gate.
4. Extend only trusted startup configuration for bounded service protocol frame limits, retaining a default of 1 MiB and a hard cap of 64 MiB. Requests and manifest content cannot change their own limits.
5. Qualify actual service manifest creation and verification above the default frame size using a large synthetic manifest. Reject malformed, oversized or untrusted configuration without weakening strict serialization or response bounds. Preserve the current task status and existing preparation-manifest contracts.
6. Implement the task's registered positive/negative assertions and immutable manifest; execute them remotely after approval, preserving command, exact revisions, complete artifacts and independent observed outcomes.

Owns: `services/hyperfide/src/preparation/manifests.ts`, `tests/hyperfide/manifests/tasks/11.1.json`, `tests/hyperfide/cases/tasks/11_1.py`, `tests/hyperfide/registrations/11.1.json`, `services/hyperfide/components/11.1.json`, `services/hyperfide/src/components/service.ts`.

Planned verification:

```sh
python3 tests/hyperfide/qualify.py --case V-038 --manifest tests/hyperfide/manifests/tasks/11.1.json && python3 tests/hyperfide/qualify.py --case V-040 --manifest tests/hyperfide/manifests/tasks/11.1.json
```

Outputs: `artifacts/hyperfide/tasks/11.1/manifest.json`, `artifacts/hyperfide/tasks/11.1/evidence-index.json`.

Registered task-component variant only; all cases remain UNRUN now. This task receipt cannot replace any required full-case/provider/connector/campaign receipt.

### Task 2.1 — Import pinned run specifications with immutable revision identity

Pending · wave 7 · owner `specification` · clause `2.1`

Requires: 4.1, 4.2, 14.1.

1. Import KVX criteria, task identities, repositories, allowed actions and closure policy into one pinned run revision; export revision-labelled KVX projections.
2. Reject stale projection writes and preserve declared legacy status as history; load both large fixtures without treating declarations as runtime proof.
3. Register this module through its task-owned component fragment in the established service entrypoint and verify its externally observable internal API behavior; an unreferenced source file or direct function-only test cannot satisfy the component gate.
4. Retain the public synthetic V-001 and V-024 component qualifier calls, and append the required private-corpus qualification command with fail-closed shell conjunction. The selected private corpus must exist; its absence or any qualifier/checker failure returns nonzero. The private-corpus leg runs on the supervisory host where the private corpus lives, as an approved exception recorded in the run policy (decisions E-01); the public V-001 and V-024 legs run on the fleet like every other remote verification.
5. Implement --qualify-private-corpus inside the already-owned task probe. Resolve only trusted ignored fixture references and generate immutable private registry, registration and manifest files entirely under ignored storage. Invoke the canonical qualifier and checker using the private registry/manifest for V-024; no core harness extension is needed.
6. Preserve the public synthetic manifest without private corpus hashes, counts, paths or provenance. Private receipts remain separate from public component/full-case status, and task verification metadata must not import private content.
7. Use the trusted ignored source descriptor supplied by the task owner, preserving its restrictive permissions. The private mode must require every explicitly selected source and its canonical private registration; it must not silently shrink the selected corpus. No descriptor contents are copied into public metadata.
8. Implement the task's registered positive/negative assertions and immutable manifest; execute them remotely after approval, preserving command, exact revisions, complete artifacts and independent observed outcomes.

Owns: `services/hyperfide/src/spec/import.ts`, `tests/hyperfide/manifests/tasks/2.1.json`, `tests/hyperfide/cases/tasks/2_1.py`, `tests/hyperfide/registrations/2.1.json`, `services/hyperfide/components/2.1.json`, `services/hyperfide/migrations/0002-spec.sql`, `services/hyperfide/src/spec/bootstrap.ts`.

Planned verification:

```sh
python3 tests/hyperfide/qualify.py --case V-001 --manifest tests/hyperfide/manifests/tasks/2.1.json && python3 tests/hyperfide/qualify.py --case V-024 --manifest tests/hyperfide/manifests/tasks/2.1.json && python3 tests/hyperfide/cases/tasks/2_1.py --qualify-private-corpus
```

Outputs: `artifacts/hyperfide/tasks/2.1/manifest.json`, `artifacts/hyperfide/tasks/2.1/evidence-index.json`.

Registered task-component variant only; all cases remain UNRUN now. This task receipt cannot replace any required full-case/provider/connector/campaign receipt.

### Task 4.2 — Implement bounded primary transaction gateway

Pending · wave 4 · owner `storage` · clause `4.2`

Requires: 4.1, 1.4.

1. Build pooled short-transaction APIs for authoritative operations with explicit deadlines, deadlock retry and current-state validation.
2. Separate replica candidate discovery from primary decisions; hold no database lock across agent or provider execution and expose overload reasons.
3. Register this module through its task-owned component fragment in the established service entrypoint and verify its externally observable internal API behavior; an unreferenced source file or direct function-only test cannot satisfy the component gate.
4. Own the long-lived per-process shared resource container: bounded primary/replica PostgreSQL pools with service-specific credentials, transaction capability handles, listener connections where needed, cancellation and deterministic shutdown. Components must reuse this container rather than create hidden independent global pools.
5. Extend the established component registry through an explicit task1.4-to4.2 ownership transfer. Resolve declared same-role dependency capabilities against initialized component instances, reject missing or role-incompatible dependencies before readiness, and dispose dependants before shared resources. Preserve control/provisioner/dispatch process separation; cross-role work remains durable queue/API communication.
6. Exercise at least two registered components through the actual service dispatcher using the same process-owned PostgreSQL resources; verify bounded connection use, shared committed state and shutdown. Direct helper tests alone do not establish runtime composition.
7. Take storage/schema.ts ownership from qualified task 4.1 before replacing its module-owned getPool(env)/closePool lifecycle internals with the task 4.2 process-owned shared resource container. Preserve the public facade and schema contracts so other components continue to share the same bounded resources; component shutdown must not prematurely close resources still used by other components.
8. Preserve checksummed ordered migration-engine ownership in task 4.4. Task 4.2 may expose the shared transaction/resource capability used by that engine, but must not independently implement or claim ownership of a competing migration runner.
9. Implement the task's registered positive/negative assertions and immutable manifest; execute them remotely after approval, preserving command, exact revisions, complete artifacts and independent observed outcomes.

Owns: `services/hyperfide/src/storage/transactions.ts`, `tests/hyperfide/manifests/tasks/4.2.json`, `tests/hyperfide/cases/tasks/4_2.py`, `tests/hyperfide/registrations/4.2.json`, `services/hyperfide/components/4.2.json`, `services/hyperfide/src/storage/runtime.ts`, `services/hyperfide/src/components/registry.ts`, `services/hyperfide/src/storage/schema.ts`.

Planned verification:

```sh
python3 tests/hyperfide/qualify.py --case V-002 --manifest tests/hyperfide/manifests/tasks/4.2.json && python3 tests/hyperfide/qualify.py --case V-011 --manifest tests/hyperfide/manifests/tasks/4.2.json
```

Outputs: `artifacts/hyperfide/tasks/4.2/manifest.json`, `artifacts/hyperfide/tasks/4.2/evidence-index.json`.

Registered task-component variant only; all cases remain UNRUN now. This task receipt cannot replace any required full-case/provider/connector/campaign receipt.

### Task 10.1 — Build Blaxel coding images with qualified writable storage and mounts

Pending · wave 4 · owner `blaxel` · clause `10.1`

Requires: 8.1, 11.1, 1.4.

1. Retain sandbox API and compilers/build tools, disable incompatible slimming and size RAM-backed writable overlays versus persistent volumes.
2. Test mount-over-preloaded paths and pnpm/uv-style symlink/hardlink templates; validate actual toolchains and package resolution after mounting.
3. Separate deterministic image/storage contract probes from actual image creation/mount/toolchain probes. Real-provider acceptance requires an approved small live manifest with actual package resolution; a simulator receipt cannot satisfy it.
4. Register this module through its task-owned component fragment in the established service entrypoint and verify its externally observable internal API behavior; an unreferenced source file or direct function-only test cannot satisfy the component gate.
5. Take exclusive package manifest/lock ownership from task1.4 after foundation qualification. Add the qualified pinned Blaxel SDK dependency and update its lockfile as one bounded handoff; preserve all existing runtime/dependency pins.
6. The inspected @blaxel/core0.3.30 SDK does not expose the required image-slimming control. Use a qualified pinned native Blaxel publisher CLI execution-profile capability and generate its blaxel.toml with [build] slim=false inside the owned images.ts preparation path; SDK-only publication must not silently strip coding toolchains. No new tracked Dockerfile or install script is required by this handoff.
7. Implement the task's registered positive/negative assertions and immutable manifest; execute them remotely after approval, preserving command, exact revisions, complete artifacts and independent observed outcomes.

Owns: `services/hyperfide/src/providers/blaxel/images.ts`, `tests/hyperfide/manifests/tasks/10.1.json`, `tests/hyperfide/cases/tasks/10_1.py`, `tests/hyperfide/registrations/10.1.json`, `services/hyperfide/components/10.1.json`, `services/hyperfide/package.json`, `services/hyperfide/package-lock.json`.

Planned verification:

```sh
python3 tests/hyperfide/qualify.py --case V-038 --manifest tests/hyperfide/manifests/tasks/10.1.json && python3 tests/hyperfide/qualify.py --case V-039 --manifest tests/hyperfide/manifests/tasks/10.1.json
```

Outputs: `artifacts/hyperfide/tasks/10.1/manifest.json`, `artifacts/hyperfide/tasks/10.1/evidence-index.json`.

Registered task-component variant only; all cases remain UNRUN now. This task receipt cannot replace any required full-case/provider/connector/campaign receipt.

### Task 14.1 — Enroll role-scoped identities bound to intent and boot generation

Pending · wave 6 · owner `identity` · clause `14.1`

Requires: 4.1, 8.1, 4.2, 1.4, 11.1, 4.4.

1. Keep provider administration credentials only in provisioner scope; exchange one-use/controlled bootstrap grants bound to provisioning intent/boot for runner identity.
2. Replay enrollment from another sandbox/generation and forge role events; server-side authority rejects access independently of model text.
3. Register this module through its task-owned component fragment in the established service entrypoint and verify its externally observable internal API behavior; an unreferenced source file or direct function-only test cannot satisfy the component gate.
4. Own the authenticated coordinator HTTPS listener and persistent daemon lifecycle. Transfer components/service.ts from task1.4 and components/registry.ts from task4.2 before editing them; reuse handleRequest and the initialized registry/shared resources rather than create another dispatcher. Bind readiness to successful policy, resource, component and listener initialization; shut down listeners and background workers before shared resources.
5. Validate TLS server identity, bounded request/response sizes, deadlines, concurrent request admission and the versioned external protocol envelope. Explicitly map operation identity, idempotency key, payload digest, correlation/causation and expected-version fields to internal dispatch; a JSONL correlation id is not durable idempotency.
6. Bind an immutable trusted actor/run/role/attempt context to each invocation after authentication. Wire payloads cannot select or replace identity, startup policy or shared resource capabilities. Limit unauthenticated enrollment to valid scoped bootstrap grants; deny non-granted remote operations by default and provide the later task14.4 authorization module an explicit middleware/capability hook. Local stdio access must not bypass remote identity requirements.
7. Run the listener in an explicit service mode whose lifetime does not depend on stdin remaining open. Qualify real separate-process HTTPS enrollment and authenticated requests, malformed/wrong-peer/wrong-scope requests, startup failure and orderly termination using designated test credentials only.
8. Add the owned enrollment SQL migration for durable bootstrap-grant verification/consumption and principal key, expiry, revocation and boot-identity uniqueness under services/hyperfide/migrations/0014-enrollment.sql.
9. Refuse enrollment service readiness when the required database schema or migration version is absent. Never run DDL or automatic schema migration from enrollment request handling or service startup. Task 14.1 tests may apply the trusted owned SQL fixture explicitly; the production ordered/checksummed runner is owned by task 4.4 and discovers the migration.
10. Owning this migration file does not add task 4.4 as a predecessor or shift task 14.1 to a later wave. Preserve existing dependencies and the root-authorised preparation/qualification boundary.
11. Implement the task's registered positive/negative assertions and immutable manifest; execute them remotely after approval, preserving command, exact revisions, complete artifacts and independent observed outcomes.

Owns: `services/hyperfide/src/identity/enrollment.ts`, `tests/hyperfide/manifests/tasks/14.1.json`, `tests/hyperfide/cases/tasks/14_1.py`, `tests/hyperfide/registrations/14.1.json`, `services/hyperfide/components/14.1.json`, `services/hyperfide/src/transport/http.ts`, `services/hyperfide/src/transport/protocol.ts`, `services/hyperfide/src/components/service.ts`, `services/hyperfide/src/components/registry.ts`, `services/hyperfide/migrations/0014-enrollment.sql`, `tests/hyperfide/support/identity_fixture.py`.

### Task 15.2 — Store complete immutable artifacts with receipts and checksums

Planning baseline pending · wave 7 · owner `artifacts` · clause `15.2`

Requires: 4.1, 4.2, 14.1.

1. Implement content-addressed/immutable objects, chunk sequences, completeness manifests, upload receipts, retention classes and database registrations.
2. Crash between upload/registration and corrupt/truncate/replay chunks; incomplete provider backfill or missing objects cannot become accepted complete evidence.
3. Register this module through its task-owned component fragment in the established service entrypoint and verify its externally observable internal API behavior; an unreferenced source file or direct function-only test cannot satisfy the component gate.
4. Implement the task's registered positive/negative assertions and immutable manifest; execute them remotely after approval, preserving command, exact revisions, complete artifacts and independent observed outcomes.

### Task 15.1 — Publish attributable attempt source and recoverable workspace checkpoints

Pending · wave 8 · owner `artifacts` · clause `15.1`

Requires: 4.1, 11.1, 15.2.

1. Create immutable source/checkpoint manifests preserving repository identity, attempt branches, committed/uncommitted changes, session references and dependency/environment inputs.
2. Lose a sandbox after a dirty checkpoint and reuse branch names across repositories; verify source identity and complete recovery envelope rather than names alone.
3. Link this module through its task-owned native component/build fragment and exercise the resulting runner/client interface; disconnected compilation cannot satisfy the component gate. Public legacy/new CLI integration remains task25.3/26.2 responsibility.
4. Take Makefile ownership after foundation task 1.4 to link the existing src/sha256.c implementation into the native component helper path used by checkpoint qualification. Reuse the existing hash implementation and introduce no new dependency. Preserve the standalone component ABI and prior source-discovery validation.
5. Implement the task's registered positive/negative assertions and immutable manifest; execute them remotely after approval, preserving command, exact revisions, complete artifacts and independent observed outcomes.

Owns: `src/hyperfide/checkpoint.c`, `tests/hyperfide/manifests/tasks/15.1.json`, `tests/hyperfide/cases/tasks/15_1.py`, `tests/hyperfide/registrations/15.1.json`, `src/hyperfide/components/15.1.kvx`, `Makefile`.

### Task 2.2 — Validate cross-programme dependency graphs and explicit milestones

Planning baseline pending · wave 8 · owner `specification` · clause `2.2`

Requires: 2.1, 14.1, 4.2.

1. Validate unknown references, cycles, contradictory scope ownership and wave constraints using fully qualified feature/programme/repository identities.
2. Emit concrete cycle paths and prose-reference diagnostics; distinguish qualified-revision dependencies from integrated-target dependencies.
3. Register this module through its task-owned component fragment in the established service entrypoint and verify its externally observable internal API behavior; an unreferenced source file or direct function-only test cannot satisfy the component gate.
4. Implement the task's registered positive/negative assertions and immutable manifest; execute them remotely after approval, preserving command, exact revisions, complete artifacts and independent observed outcomes.

### Task 3.1 — Register leader, manager, wave-package and execution role ownership

Pending · wave 8 · owner `hierarchy` · clause `3.1`

Requires: 2.1, 4.2.

1. Implement leader epochs, accountable manager packages, wave allocations and distinct worker/reviewer/integrator roles.
2. Expose stable cross-wave manager ownership as proposed selectable policy; retain explicit wave-based manager allocation and auditable handoff.
3. Register this module through its task-owned component fragment in the established service entrypoint and verify its externally observable internal API behavior; an unreferenced source file or direct function-only test cannot satisfy the component gate.
4. Add the owned hierarchy migration for scoped leader ownership/generation and manager-package policy, lifecycle and handoff history. Leader generation is distinct from runs.authority_epoch, which identifies restore/platform authority; do not reuse one field for both contracts.
5. Refuse hierarchy service readiness until the required hierarchy migration is present. Trusted test setup may apply the owned fixture migration; never execute DDL inside hierarchy request handlers. The production ordered/checksummed migration engine remains task 4.4.
6. Add task 4.2 as an explicit prerequisite because hierarchy transitions consume its primary transaction gateway. Preserve the existing wave; the owned SQL file does not itself add task 4.4 as a predecessor.
7. Implement the task's registered positive/negative assertions and immutable manifest; execute them remotely after approval, preserving command, exact revisions, complete artifacts and independent observed outcomes.

### Task 4.4 — Establish database migration, durability and old-primary fencing

Pending · wave 5 · owner `storage` · clause `4.4`

Requires: 4.2.

1. Implement checksummed schema migration coordination, authority epoch bootstrap and configurable acknowledged-write durability outside the main failure domain.
2. Exercise primary loss and old-primary isolation before reopening writes; document and test backup retention/RPO assumptions instead of assuming async replication is lossless.
3. Register this module through its task-owned component fragment in the established service entrypoint and verify its externally observable internal API behavior; an unreferenced source file or direct function-only test cannot satisfy the component gate.
4. Take services/hyperfide/src/storage/schema.ts ownership after task 4.2 and add the owned durability migration. Preserve the original authority migration bytes and historical task 4.1 component evidence; new current-state qualification belongs to task 4.4.
5. Retire general-service bootstrap DDL in favor of a dedicated migration operator role. Transactional migration application uses the qualified shared advisory-lock namespace, ordered discovery and checksums; ordinary service operations must refuse schema-changing privileges and readiness must require the expected applied checksum set.
6. Qualify privilege separation and readiness refusal against actual disposable PostgreSQL processes. Production authority epoch activation requires trusted external old-primary/control-writer fencing; caller booleans or matching epoch rows do not prove fencing. Component drills do not qualify cloud high availability or independent failure domains.
7. Implement the task's registered positive/negative assertions and immutable manifest; execute them remotely after approval, preserving command, exact revisions, complete artifacts and independent observed outcomes.

Requires: 4.2, 14.1.

1. Commit state changes with pending delivery records, persist acknowledgement and retry metadata and dispatch only committed obligations.
2. Invert commit order after sequence allocation; prove a late lower sequence cannot be skipped by a higher consumer cursor.
3. Register this module through its task-owned component fragment in the established service entrypoint and verify its externally observable internal API behavior; an unreferenced source file or direct function-only test cannot satisfy the component gate.

1. Key extraction by repository/tree or named overlay, parser/config version and generation; emit remotely produced graph bundles with provenance.
2. Reject cross-branch identity mixing and label optional local caches non-authoritative; preserve current source/body/comment extraction coverage.
3. Register this module through its task-owned component fragment in the established service entrypoint and verify its externally observable internal API behavior; an unreferenced source file or direct function-only test cannot satisfy the component gate.

### Task 12.1 — Register supervisor boots and isolate writable worker slots

Pending · wave 9 · owner `runner` · clause `12.1`

Requires: 14.1, 11.1, 1.4, 15.1, 4.2.

1. Register boot/capability/preparation/slot inventory and allocate separate worktree/build/home/temp/ports with explicit security isolation profiles.
2. Run colliding builds and credential-sensitive jobs; separate worktrees are not accepted as an OS boundary and unsafe co-location is refused.
3. Link this module through its task-owned native component/build fragment and exercise the resulting runner/client interface; disconnected compilation cannot satisfy the component gate. Public legacy/new CLI integration remains task25.3/26.2 responsibility.
4. Own a reusable native HTTPS transport linked against libcurl with a qualified TLS backend. Transfer Makefile and the native component link/build contract from task1.4 after its foundation work is complete before extending them; declare libcurl headers, libraries, TLS backend and runtime dependency versions in the remote build/preparation manifests. Do not implement TLS through shell-command interpolation or relax certificate/hostname verification.
5. Extend the actual scripts/hyperfide-native-components.py build helper alongside Makefile and the native fragment schema. Its validated component source/header/library declarations must support the shared libcurl transport and export a source/link contract usable by the later public CLI build, while excluding duplicate standalone-main definitions.
6. Implement outbound bootstrap enrollment, supervisor registration, heartbeat and reconnect against task14.1 coordinator HTTPS operations. Enforce explicit endpoint identity, request deadlines, bounded response handling, credential rotation and conservative reconnect/backoff. Sandboxes receive no general PostgreSQL credentials.
7. Connect the real supervisor process lifecycle to authenticated network registration and slot inventory, using server-returned identity and current boot generation. Prove correct-server success and wrong-certificate/wrong-host/revoked-token failure over actual sockets in a remote disposable fixture.
8. For the accepted Ed25519 proof direction, link the native runner/client with libcrypto in addition to libcurl and the qualified TLS backend. Use OpenSSL 3.0 or newer and libcurl 7.85 or newer when relying on EVP *_ex and CURLOPT_PROTOCOLS_STR; pin actual qualified development/runtime versions and headers in the existing remote preparation/build contract. These are native link prerequisites; the main CLI inherits them only when it actually links the native transport.
9. Use the qualified bounded PureEd25519 EVP signing/verification interface, without homegrown cryptography, for the exact request-byte contract frozen jointly by task 14.1 and the native owner. Preserve TLS peer/hostname verification. Exercise the actual native proof against the task 14.1 HTTPS service, including modified payload, replay, wrong key and revoked identity. Wire details stay provisional until these interoperability probes pass.
10. Implement the task's registered positive/negative assertions and immutable manifest; execute them remotely after approval, preserving command, exact revisions, complete artifacts and independent observed outcomes.

Requires: 14.1.

1. Implement distinct image/build/runtime/process layers, secret-reference resolution, designated-canary redaction and revoke/rotate protocols.
2. Race refresh writers and split secrets across chunks; dependency hooks/other slots cannot read forbidden secrets, and reusable images/packets/logs contain no live credentials.
3. Register this module through its task-owned component fragment in the established service entrypoint and verify its externally observable internal API behavior; an unreferenced source file or direct function-only test cannot satisfy the component gate.

1. Apply role/run/attempt policies to controller operations, artifact namespaces and permitted decision destinations; isolate protected Git credentials from workers.
2. Attempt cross-run access, stale overwrite, repository/log prompt injection and disallowed model fallback; reject all authority expansion through untrusted content.
3. Register this module through its task-owned component fragment in the established service entrypoint and verify its externally observable internal API behavior; an unreferenced source file or direct function-only test cannot satisfy the component gate.

### Task 25.1 — Inventory actual SQLite shapes and import historical state with provenance

Pending · wave 8 · owner `migration` · clause `25.1`

Requires: 4.1, 2.1, 15.2.

1. Read actual tables/columns including same-v18 additive variants; inventory external journals/config/memory/attempt/event/graph/docs evidence and WAL-safe snapshots.
2. Map IDs by source database/repository/key deterministically, preserve unavailable provenance and import active/forced claims as reconciliation/history rather than qualification.
3. Register this module through its task-owned component fragment in the established service entrypoint and verify its externally observable internal API behavior; an unreferenced source file or direct function-only test cannot satisfy the component gate.
4. Add the owned historical-import staging and provenance migration. Preserve historical declared task/attempt state outside live authority tables; never turn imported historical completion into current task ownership or qualification.
5. Refuse historical-import readiness when the required migration is absent. Trusted test setup may apply the owned SQL fixture; task 4.4 owns production discovery/application. No request-handler DDL or new migration-only predecessor is introduced.
6. Use the approved Node runtime built-in SQLite API for source snapshots; this amendment requires no package manifest or lockfile dependency change.

Pending · wave 10 · owner `railway` · clause `9.1`

Requires: 8.1, 11.1, 14.1, 12.1, 10.1.

1. Pin Railway SDK/runtime and implement templates, captures, checkpoint ID/key compatibility and same-environment/region preparation affinity.
2. Fork a sentinel process and file: validate disk restoration and fresh runner identity without assuming process memory survives; reject contaminated preparation.
3. Component probes may use a recorded deterministic provider contract fixture, labelled as simulated; real disk/fresh-enrollment behavior requires an explicitly approved small live provider manifest before provider acceptance. Missing live credentials block that variant and cannot become a simulator PASS.
4. Register this module through its task-owned component fragment in the established service entrypoint and verify its externally observable internal API behavior; an unreferenced source file or direct function-only test cannot satisfy the component gate.
5. Take exclusive package manifest/lock ownership from completed task10.1 before adding the qualified pinned Railway SDK dependency. Preserve prior Blaxel/runtime pins and all existing task prerequisites; no concurrent shared lockfile editing.

1. Implement transactional dependency/wave/scope/role/run validation with one current task owner and multidimensional capacity reservations.
2. Race managers at quota boundaries and count creating, prepared and uncertain resources; report the precise failed admission dimension.
3. Exclude every active coordinator-owned submission custody from compute-expiry reclaim, including submitted, qualifying, qualified and integrating work; retain uncertain occupied resource accounting until quiescence or explicit orphan allocation is established.
4. Register this module through its task-owned component fragment in the established service entrypoint and verify its externally observable internal API behavior; an unreferenced source file or direct function-only test cannot satisfy the component gate.

Planning baseline pending · wave 8 · owner `delivery` · clause `6.2`

Requires: 6.1.

1. Deduplicate events by identity and apply expected revisions; define explicit resynchronisation when retention creates a gap.
2. Reorder, duplicate, truncate and replay delivery; terminal actions and source provenance cannot regress or duplicate effects.
3. Register this module through its task-owned component fragment in the established service entrypoint and verify its externally observable internal API behavior; an unreferenced source file or direct function-only test cannot satisfy the component gate.

Requires: 7.1, 4.2, 14.1.

1. Implement bounded COPY/staging chunks and set-based reference resolution with independent coordination/graph admission and idempotent chunk identities.
2. Interrupt upload and resolution, race branches and count network queries; avoid per-symbol network amplification and long ownership-blocking transactions.
3. Register this module through its task-owned component fragment in the established service entrypoint and verify its externally observable internal API behavior; an unreferenced source file or direct function-only test cannot satisfy the component gate.

### Task 14.3 — Qualify account-session and API authentication modes separately

Planning baseline pending · wave 8 · owner `identity` · clause `14.3`

Requires: 14.2.

1. Resolve the unanswered current-auth choice through non-secret operator configuration and qualified per-connector account/API profiles.
2. Exercise concurrent refresh/72-hour renewal assumptions within approved account guidance; unsupported portability or arbitrary host-auth-directory copying blocks that mode.
3. The foundation variant uses standalone pinned native-CLI authentication probes and controlled refresh-race fixtures, without depending on the later connector transport. It does not claim a 72-hour renewal result; task13.1 proves connector integration and task27.3 records actual endurance.
4. Register this module through its task-owned component fragment in the established service entrypoint and verify its externally observable internal API behavior; an unreferenced source file or direct function-only test cannot satisfy the component gate.

Requires: 14.2, 1.4.

1. Pin requested respan/span-02, typesafe/jev-1.14 and liquid/d1-ultra route IDs/context/modality/question capability and response schemas; retain current Jev/recap configuration migration.
2. Reject unsupported number/box/vision/experimental paths; native and gateway routes have distinct qualified profiles rather than assumed interchangeability.
3. Qualify schema/transport parsing first with fixed malformed and valid response fixtures; record real native/gateway response and billing qualification separately under an approved model-call manifest. Optional routes remain disabled until their own live probe passes.
4. Register this module through its task-owned component fragment in the established service entrypoint and verify its externally observable internal API behavior; an unreferenced source file or direct function-only test cannot satisfy the component gate.

### Task 11.3 — Probe actual environment readiness before assignment

Planning baseline pending · wave 10 · owner `preparation` · clause `11.3`

Requires: 11.2, 14.2.

1. Probe tools/source/credential availability/storage/network and required execution features against the published manifest after mounts and runtime injection.
2. Return typed failures without secret disclosure; provider RUNNING alone and stale preparation manifests cannot make a slot READY.
3. Link this module through its task-owned native component/build fragment and exercise the resulting runner/client interface; disconnected compilation cannot satisfy the component gate. Public legacy/new CLI integration remains task25.3/26.2 responsibility.
4. Implement the task's registered positive/negative assertions and immutable manifest; execute them remotely after approval, preserving command, exact revisions, complete artifacts and independent observed outcomes.

1. Build versioned packets binding spec/task/attempt/generation/parent/manager, exact source inputs, scope, contracts, obligations, limits and environment profile.
2. Hash mandatory intent and constraints independently from optional ranked context; reject missing identities and incompatible revisions.
3. Register this module through its task-owned component fragment in the established service entrypoint and verify its externally observable internal API behavior; an unreferenced source file or direct function-only test cannot satisfy the component gate.

### Task 5.2 — Enforce monotonic generations and primary-clock leases

Planning baseline pending · wave 13 · owner `scheduler` · clause `5.2`

Requires: 5.1.

1. Issue monotonic attempt generations, primary-clock expiry and generation-bearing renew/result/cancel requests; reject missing or stale authority.
2. Race expiry, renewal and reassignment with skewed clocks; retain useful stale artifacts without resurrecting ownership.
3. Separate worker compute authority from admitted immutable submission custody; serialize renewal, submission, custody revocation and reassignment. Idempotent submission replay resolves its prior outcome before checking the now-released worker lease; primary-clock expiry never reclaims active custody.
4. Register this module through its task-owned component fragment in the established service entrypoint and verify its externally observable internal API behavior; an unreferenced source file or direct function-only test cannot satisfy the component gate.

2. Exercise queued build/model/review waits, starvation and backpressure; native descendants and provision reservations remain counted.
3. Register this module through its task-owned component fragment in the established service entrypoint and verify its externally observable internal API behavior; an unreferenced source file or direct function-only test cannot satisfy the component gate.

### Task 6.4 — Recover durable dispatch after controller restart

Planning baseline pending · wave 15 · owner `delivery` · clause `6.4`

Requires: 6.2, 14.1, 6.3.

1. Use notifications/streams only as wakeups over durable queues and periodic reconciliation; restore unacknowledged obligations after restart.
2. Lose stream notifications and crash dispatch before/after external send; prove committed work remains discoverable without an always-live subscription.
3. Register this module through its task-owned component fragment in the established service entrypoint and verify its externally observable internal API behavior; an unreferenced source file or direct function-only test cannot satisfy the component gate.
4. Own the continuously running dispatch-role delivery worker: claim committed pending delivery rows, invoke registered delivery handlers, persist acknowledgement/retry outcomes, and periodically reconcile independently of notifications. Use the established daemon lifecycle and process-owned PostgreSQL resources; no stdin EOF or transient stream disconnect may terminate durable delivery silently.
5. Keep command publication and acknowledgement coordinated with task6.3 API bindings. Start separate control and dispatch processes against the same PostgreSQL fixture, commit work in one, observe delivery in the other, restart the dispatcher and prove the same logical effect after lost acknowledgement.

Planning baseline pending · wave 14 · owner `scheduler` · clause `5.3`

Requires: 5.2, 6.1, 1.1, 5.4, 6.2.

1. Bind dispatch requests to stable operation identity and persisted outcomes; reconcile uncertain create/spawn effects before compatible replacement.
2. Lose responses across crash windows and return delayed surviving workers; permit duplicate physical execution only with one accepted authority.
3. Register this module through its task-owned component fragment in the established service entrypoint and verify its externally observable internal API behavior; an unreferenced source file or direct function-only test cannot satisfy the component gate.
4. Implement the task's registered positive/negative assertions and immutable manifest; execute them remotely after approval, preserving command, exact revisions, complete artifacts and independent observed outcomes.

3. Register this module through its task-owned component fragment in the established service entrypoint and verify its externally observable internal API behavior; an unreferenced source file or direct function-only test cannot satisfy the component gate.
4. Bind command poll/delivery, ordered steering/cancel, acknowledgement and structured event-ingress operations into the authenticated coordinator API with exact runner/boot/attempt scope. Make durable command state discoverable on reconnect; a failed response never implies command absence.
5. Exercise the actual HTTPS API and durable inbox/outbox state across lost delivery/acknowledgement and duplicate instruction delivery. An isolated instructions handler cannot substitute for the network binding.

### Task 8.3 — Persist provisioning intents and quarantine ambiguous or orphan resources

Planning baseline pending · wave 16 · owner `providers` · clause `8.3`

Requires: 8.2, 5.3, 6.4, 14.1, 5.4.

1. Record intent before external create, persist returned IDs early and completely paginate inventory for reconciliation.
2. Interrupt create/readiness/delete responses; retain uncertain quota consumption, quarantine ambiguous resources and clean only resources with established ownership.
3. Register this module through its task-owned component fragment in the established service entrypoint and verify its externally observable internal API behavior; an unreferenced source file or direct function-only test cannot satisfy the component gate.
4. Own the persistent provisioner-role worker that claims durable provisioning intents and invokes the configured provider adapter create/observe/destroy methods with bounded concurrency. Persist returned identifiers and uncertain outcomes through the actual shared authority; method wrappers without an executing worker are insufficient.
5. Keep provider administration credentials only in the provisioner process. Control and dispatch communicate with it through durable PostgreSQL obligations or authenticated internal operations, not through cross-role in-process capability injection. A configured pool with a missing or incompatible adapter cannot report operational readiness.
6. Prove the provisioner consumes a committed intent from a separately running control process, records adapter-observed state, resumes reconciliation after worker restart and leaves ambiguous external outcomes visible. Controlled adapter fixtures qualify this composition only; real provider behavior still requires its dedicated live variants.
7. Implement the task's registered positive/negative assertions and immutable manifest; execute them remotely after approval, preserving command, exact revisions, complete artifacts and independent observed outcomes.

1. Qualify coordinator/Git/artifact/model reachability per pool without cross-environment private DNS assumptions; apply region/profile compatibility rules.
2. Inject rate limits and provider partitions; bounded relocation preserves source/environment/fence identities and requires fresh enrollment.

1. Durably accept generation-bound starts before spawn, record process/session associations and retain supervisor-owned IPC independently of controller transport.
2. Crash immediately before/after spawn and ledger writes; inspect/adopt existing process or record uncertainty rather than blindly launching another session.
3. Link this module through its task-owned native component/build fragment and exercise the resulting runner/client interface; disconnected compilation cannot satisfy the component gate. Public legacy/new CLI integration remains task25.3/26.2 responsibility.
4. Use task12.1 shared native transport for command polling, start/steer/cancel delivery, acknowledgements, lease renewal and structured event upload. Connect durable local instruction/start records to actual agent process spawning and reconnect; do not leave launch execution accessible only through isolated component-dispatch tests.
5. Run a separate coordinator/dispatch process and a native supervisor process over HTTPS, interrupt their transport around spawn/ack windows, and verify restored command identity, existing-process adoption and bounded spool replay without duplicate logical starts.

### Task 11.5 — Materialise packet-scoped workspace slices for very large repositories

Planning baseline pending · wave 18 · owner `preparation` · clause `11.5`

Requires: 11.1, 11.3, 7.3, 3.2.

1. Derive a task's workspace slice from its packet: declared touches, the published graph generation's dependency closure (imports, build targets, test fixtures, shared contracts and registry files) and the build system's required roots; emit an immutable slice manifest (pinned commit, graph generation, included paths, excluded roots, digest) and materialise it with partial clone plus sparse checkout into the writable slot.
2. Keep qualification exact under a slice: build, test and verify commands run against the slice; receipts record slice identity; a slice whose closure derivation is incomplete falls back to the full tree with a recorded reason; out-of-slice reads and writes during execution are detected and either refused or widened explicitly, never ignored.
3. Inject a missing closure edge, a touch outside the slice, a build root the slice excluded, submodule/LFS paths inside the slice and a graph generation older than the pinned commit; verify refusal or explicit widening, byte identity of included paths against the full tree, and measured materialisation cost against the full-tree baseline on a fixture exceeding 20,000 files and ten languages.
4. Register this module through its task-owned component fragment in the established service entrypoint and verify its externally observable internal API behavior; an unreferenced source file or direct function-only test cannot satisfy the component gate.
5. Implement the task's registered positive/negative assertions and immutable manifest; execute them remotely after approval, preserving command, exact revisions, complete artifacts and independent observed outcomes.

Requires: 12.2, 3.4.

1. Track descendants, boot/PID identity, job limits and progress events separately from sandbox reachability/process liveness/assurance validity.
2. Kill/reuse PIDs, spawn native children and saturate quotas; entire process trees remain accountable for cancellation and checkpoints.
3. Link this module through its task-owned native component/build fragment and exercise the resulting runner/client interface; disconnected compilation cannot satisfy the component gate. Public legacy/new CLI integration remains task25.3/26.2 responsibility.
4. Implement the task's registered positive/negative assertions and immutable manifest; execute them remotely after approval, preserving command, exact revisions, complete artifacts and independent observed outcomes.

1. Qualify actual launch/input/output/steer/cancel/child/resume capabilities for each pinned CLI/auth mode and resolve user frontier aliases from real configuration.
2. Exercise actual authorised native launches and unsupported-option refusal; do not simulate preserved context or substitute decision models for coding workers.
3. Link this module through its task-owned native component/build fragment and exercise the resulting runner/client interface; disconnected compilation cannot satisfy the component gate. Public legacy/new CLI integration remains task25.3/26.2 responsibility.

### Task 15.4 — Implement reference-safe retention, garbage collection and destruction gates

Planning baseline pending · wave 19 · owner `artifacts` · clause `15.4`

Requires: 15.2, 8.3, 15.3.

1. Track active evidence/findings/publication/recovery references, retention policy and garbage-collection tombstones before destruction.
2. Crash cleanup and leave unreachable provider resources; required source/evidence survives and unresolved deletions remain visible debt.
3. Register this module through its task-owned component fragment in the established service entrypoint and verify its externally observable internal API behavior; an unreferenced source file or direct function-only test cannot satisfy the component gate.

### Task 16.1 — Submit immutable worker results and dispatch independent qualification

Planning baseline pending · wave 17 · owner `assurance` · clause `16.1`

Requires: 2.4, 5.2, 15.2, 12.2, 6.4, 8.3, 14.4, 11.3, 13.1, 3.2, 5.1.

1. Admit generation-bound immutable source/evidence/criteria/contract submission manifests with idempotent conflicting-payload rejection.
2. Run required checks in separate clean remote qualification environments; worker completion text or process exit cannot qualify its own task.
3. Atomically validate current compute authority and complete immutable artifacts, create active coordinator submission custody, release original compute authority and schedule independent verification jobs under their own leases. Race the expiry sweeper, lost-response replay and coding-sandbox cleanup; admitted custody remains valid through qualification and integration.
4. Register this module through its task-owned component fragment in the established service entrypoint and verify its externally observable internal API behavior; an unreferenced source file or direct function-only test cannot satisfy the component gate.
5. Own a mandatory connected-stack integration variant using separately running control, dispatch and provisioner services, a real disposable PostgreSQL database, the coordinator HTTPS listener and a real native supervisor process. Exercise imported run/packet creation, eligibility/claim, durable dispatch, preparation/readiness, actual process spawn, immutable artifact submission, compute-to-custody transfer and independent qualification after coding-slot cleanup.
6. Restart dispatch and interrupt the network between commit/send/ack; observe actual process identity, PostgreSQL records and immutable artifacts independently. The connected variant cannot be satisfied by in-process registry invocation, direct handler calls, fabricated occupancy or unrelated component PASS receipts.
7. Controlled provider and agent process doubles may be explicitly selected for the first connected-stack probe, while network transport, database and service/process boundaries remain real. Such evidence never qualifies a real provider/native frontier variant; those require their own approved live probes and campaign receipts. Required full-case inventories must include this connected-stack assertion family.
8. Implement the task's registered positive/negative assertions and immutable manifest; execute them remotely after approval, preserving command, exact revisions, complete artifacts and independent observed outcomes.

1. Implement complete inventory/session pagination, early-ID readiness recovery and installed-SDK checkpoint identifier compatibility.
2. Qualify networking/quota/idle/72-hour profile inputs through approved probes; unresolved creation is not replayed blindly and actual endurance evidence remains a later campaign gate.
3. Register this module through its task-owned component fragment in the established service entrypoint and verify its externally observable internal API behavior; an unreferenced source file or direct function-only test cannot satisfy the component gate.

1. Inspect/reconnect existing native execution on transport loss; resume qualified state or create a new identified session from provenance-bearing handoff on process loss.
2. Inject partial protocol writes, dead pipes, expired auth and absent resume state; report context loss and prevent silent source/session substitution.
3. Link this module through its task-owned native component/build fragment and exercise the resulting runner/client interface; disconnected compilation cannot satisfy the component gate. Public legacy/new CLI integration remains task25.3/26.2 responsibility.

### Task 25.3 — Route CLI, MCP, editor, hooks and offline workflows through authority modes

Planning baseline pending · wave 21 · owner `migration` · clause `25.3`

Requires: 4.3, 6.3, 16.4, 2.1, 12.2, 14.1, 12.1, 1.4, 3.1, 3.3, 4.2.

1. Integrate distributed API transport and explicit local/offline modes with work_open/update/handoff/projection/docs, CLI/MCP/editor/hooks contracts.
2. With network/PG/model credentials absent retain promised local core functions, show cache freshness and forbid offline remote ownership or stale projection overwrite.
3. Link this module through its task-owned native component/build fragment and exercise the resulting runner/client interface; disconnected compilation cannot satisfy the component gate. Public legacy/new CLI integration remains task25.3/26.2 responsibility.
4. Take Makefile ownership from task12.1 and native component_main.c/components.h dispatch/ABI ownership from task1.4. Link the registered nested src/hyperfide component and transport sources into the real public CLI/MCP binary; the existing src/*.c wildcard cannot discover them. Preserve the standalone runner build without linking two main functions, and exercise the public CLI against the running coordinator.
5. Reuse the established task12.1 native HTTPS transport and task14.1 protocol for the existing CLI/MCP/editor/hooks authority facade. Do not introduce an independent late RPC implementation, duplicate shared pools, or a path that bypasses trusted identity and expected-version checks.
6. Exercise real existing CLI and MCP entrypoints against the running coordinator, including nonzero structured errors and offline refusal of distributed authority; direct client helper calls alone cannot establish public entrypoint integration.
7. Implement the task's registered positive/negative assertions and immutable manifest; execute them remotely after approval, preserving command, exact revisions, complete artifacts and independent observed outcomes.

1. Assemble exact qualified commit sets with environment/graph/contract manifests and run mechanical/semantic/regression/system gates remotely.
2. Change one source/dependency input during qualification; affected gates invalidate while historical isolated task results remain intact.
3. Pin active custody generations for newly pending contributors and prior integration receipts for already integrated base inputs; remote candidate verification has its own job authority and resource reservation.
4. Register this module through its task-owned component fragment in the established service entrypoint and verify its externally observable internal API behavior; an unreferenced source file or direct function-only test cannot satisfy the component gate.

### Task 19.2 — Enforce sole protected-target publication gateway and CAS reconciliation

Planning baseline pending · wave 26 · owner `integration` · clause `19.2`

Requires: 19.1, 14.4, 5.2.

1. Give only the publication path protected-ref credentials; bind durable intents to expected head/candidate/generation/evidence and enforce actual Git-side authorisation.
2. Advance target head, lose Git response, return stale worker and attempt direct protected push; read back unknown outcomes before supersession and never equate a DB lease with Git fencing.
3. Maintain active contributor custody through uncertain publication and bind the separate integration publication fence; serialize explicit custody revocation with publication admission, reconcile actual Git outcomes, and release custody only by terminal integration/disposition.
4. Register this module through its task-owned component fragment in the established service entrypoint and verify its externally observable internal API behavior; an unreferenced source file or direct function-only test cannot satisfy the component gate.

### Task 26.2 — Ship canonical hyperfide entrypoint with explicit cg compatibility policy

Planning baseline pending · wave 24 · owner `branding` · clause `26.2`

Requires: 26.1, 25.3.

1. Implement proposed hyperfide command and cg alias with argument/JSON/exit parity and nonrecursive executable resolution.
2. Resolve approved release version/support window and public namespace ownership separately; never reserve or assume short alias/domain/package availability.
3. Take Makefile ownership after task25.3 and installer/release-script ownership after task26.1. Build and install an actual canonical hyperfide executable and the approved cg compatibility entrypoint from the same qualified linked implementation; a wrapper over an unbuilt or unrelated PATH executable is insufficient. Preserve all native component, libcurl and TLS link dependencies without duplicate standalone-main objects.
4. Update the actual installer, release and uninstaller paths to consume the approved canonical artifact manifest and install/remove both declared command names safely. Existing scripts/release.sh hardcodes strip/publish cg and overrides LDLIBS with legacy static flags; preserve the qualified link contract and explicitly package any required runtime libraries rather than silently dropping the new transport. Namespace and publication destinations remain configuration, never invented ownership.
5. Qualify clean remote builds, installation to a disposable prefix, both command names, argument/JSON/exit parity and uninstall against the real produced artifacts. Run documented release construction in a nonpublishing fixture; this task does not independently authorize production publication.
6. Implement the task's registered positive/negative assertions and immutable manifest; execute them remotely after approval, preserving command, exact revisions, complete artifacts and independent observed outcomes.

1. Release dependencies only at their declared qualified/integrated milestone; require accepted candidate, current criteria/reviews and blocking-finding dispositions.
2. Fail a wave gate despite passing tasks and withhold downstream/activation release; programme closure includes specified end-to-end/rehearsal obligations.
3. Compute task qualification from current custody and subsequent integration/requalification receipts; a coding lease expiring cannot invalidate admitted work or admit a competing replacement.
4. Register this module through its task-owned component fragment in the established service entrypoint and verify its externally observable internal API behavior; an unreferenced source file or direct function-only test cannot satisfy the component gate.

Requires: 19.2, 19.3.

1. Persist programme commit-set manifests, per-repository publication outcomes and release-barrier state with compensating recovery policy.
2. Interrupt between ordinary Git pushes and crash gateway; partial sets cannot appear as approved release or pretend atomic multi-repository transaction semantics.
3. Register this module through its task-owned component fragment in the established service entrypoint and verify its externally observable internal API behavior; an unreferenced source file or direct function-only test cannot satisfy the component gate.

1. Update generator-owned workflow/templates and regenerate AGENTS/CLAUDE/context/codemap/spec mirrors after approval; migrate owned MCP/hooks/editor assets with backups.
2. Test old/new commands/resources/settings, one active hook/server implementation and active session links; never hand-edit generated ownership or erase historic evidence.

### Task 27.3 — Qualify both live providers and native agents from the Paxeer X v6.12.0 production release run

Planning baseline pending · wave 30 · owner `qualification` · clause `27.3`

Requires: 27.2, 9.4, 10.4, 13.4, 11.4, 19.4, 23.3, 24.4, 22.4, 26.4, 1.2, 1.3, 14.4, 17.3, 18.2, 25.2.

1. The workload is the real production campaign, not a synthetic one: Hyperfide runs the Paxeer X v6.12.0 release fleet on its own tasks at full scale, and that run is the qualification campaign. No separate canary ladder, staged synthetic ramp or synthetic soak budget is run. Take the account, authentication mode, regions, profiles, SLOs and sustained-concurrency window from that run's pinned configuration (decisions O-01, O-02), and attribute evidence to each provider separately; the 100-sandbox target remains the combined fleet.
2. Qualify the live provider paths, credential renewal and full resource inventory from that production run's evidence, with its real native, graph/build/review/integration workloads; record actual concurrency, per-provider evidence, observed account limits, main-host exclusion and full resource inventory. Every registered case keeps its measurable acceptance unchanged, including the V-050 and V-051 durations, concurrency and session-lifetime figures; a figure the production run does not reach leaves that case unqualified rather than satisfied.
3. Implement the task's registered positive/negative assertions and immutable manifest; execute them remotely after approval, preserving command, exact revisions, complete artifacts and independent observed outcomes.

1. Implement distributed virtual@docs packet/check/close against identified candidate with durable baseline/snapshot receipt and incremental reload.
2. Inject baseline persistence failure, stale inputs and lost fence; successful connector exit or warning-only failure cannot close docs or recursively dispatch a new run.
3. Register this module through its task-owned component fragment in the established service entrypoint and verify its externally observable internal API behavior; an unreferenced source file or direct function-only test cannot satisfy the component gate.

Planning baseline pending · wave 33 · owner `release` · clause `28.4`

Requires: 27.4, 28.2, 25.2, 19.4, 15.4.

1. Carry forward public requirements, source evidence, proposed decisions, open qualifications, diagrams, task graph and independent review dispositions into release records. Optional private source audits stay access-controlled and are never a public build or qualification dependency.
2. Validate bidirectional clause/task/case/evidence mappings against the implemented revision; distinguish original approval, pack review and actual product qualification.
3. Implement traceability validation before final readiness and prove rejection of missing/tampered mappings using controlled packs. Its receipt is an input to task28.3; it does not require final release closure already to exist.
4. Register this module through its task-owned component fragment in the established service entrypoint and verify its externally observable internal API behavior; an unreferenced source file or direct function-only test cannot satisfy the component gate.

1. Run every required full registered case/variant and reconstruct all112clause obligations, candidate/programme gates, policy findings, restore/rollback/cleanup and docs receipts.
2. Tamper with hashes, omit one case and retain an unexplained resource; reject closure until exact-current evidence is complete and unsupported features remain excluded.
3. First qualify the independent closure checker against complete controlled packs and missing/tampered negative packs. Then build the candidate evidence inventory including traceability and this checker self-test receipt; seal a final closure receipt only after every required external/full-case obligation is satisfied. The receipt names its validated input inventory and does not recursively require its own digest as an input.
4. Register this module through its task-owned component fragment in the established service entrypoint and verify its externally observable internal API behavior; an unreferenced source file or direct function-only test cannot satisfy the component gate.

## Planned gates for open choices

- Account quotas/topology/networking:8.2,8.4,9.4,10.4 and27.3. Approved deployment budgets and observed account capabilities must be recorded before live execution.
- Native account/API authentication, permission and cross-sandbox resume:14.3,13.1–13.4 and27.3. No assumption of host credential portability.
- Supported runtime/SDK/database/object-store versions and durability/recovery settings:1.4,4.4,25.4 and24.4, before affected live stages.
- Canonical CLI/version/public namespaces/config migration:26.1–26.4 and25.2; unresolved namespace ownership cannot be invented.
- Small-run versus large-run concurrency, slot density and exact sustained200-session interval:23.2 and27.3, agreed before expensive live campaigns.
- Span/Jev/D1 quality/billing/routes and optional self-host:20.1–20.4 and22.1–22.4. No permanent winner or quality claim precedes evidence.

Each is a bounded implementation/qualification obligation. Open choices block only the affected capability or campaign, while unrelated approved work continues. Optional preview/self-host capabilities remain disabled unless separately qualified.
