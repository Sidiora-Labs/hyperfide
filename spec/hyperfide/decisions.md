# Hyperfide decisions and qualification register

Status: **Approved for implementation on 2026-10-16; qualification remains evidence driven.** This register distinguishes user direction, engineering recommendations and unverified enablement facts. Normative SHALL statements in the native spec describe the proposed contract; they do not imply that every design choice was separately requested or already implemented.

## 1. Functional baseline

| ID | Requirement | Contract consequence |
|---|---|---|
| U-01 | Hyperfide is the successor product name. | Deliberate branding and compatibility migration; no blind historical identifier replacement. |
| U-02 | Specification review precedes implementation. | Approval was recorded on 2026-10-16. Native KVX now tracks bootstrap progress; the catalog remains its historical pending baseline and canonical full-case qualification stays independent. |
| U-03 | Main server hosts the primary leader, feature managers and supervision. | Implementation and builds are remote; capacity is supplied by private deployment configuration. |
| U-04 | Humans interact through the primary leader; ordinary execution is agent owned. | No routine worker-console intervention or per-task approval within an authorised run policy. |
| U-05 | Managers receive wave work and request sandbox workers through Hyperfide. | Durable packages, ownership, handoffs and scoped context. |
| U-06 | Frontier engineering agents with configured Claude Code and Codex profiles. | Resolve actual supported models before dispatch; advisory models cannot replace coding workers. |
| U-07 | Large-run qualification targets 100 sandboxes, 200 concurrent remote sessions and up to 1,500 session lifetimes over 48–72 hours. | Profile-specific measured concurrency and resource admission; no claim about an existing deployment. |
| U-08 | Railway and Blaxel execution adapters. | Pool quotas, topology and account terms are private, configurable and independently qualified. |
| U-09 | PostgreSQL fleet/graph authority with replica observation and batched ingestion. | Primary consistency, causal freshness and measured performance. |
| U-10 | Dependencies are permitted for this architecture. | Explicitly version the legacy single-binary/dependency policy transition. |
| U-11 | Every configured member of a 10–15-watcher pool reviews every relevant commit; ten-minute issue reconciliation. | Any coverage reduction or cadence change requires an accepted policy amendment. |
| U-12 | Mechanical and semantic assurance plus bounded Span/Jev/D1 decision assistance. | Independent evidence decides qualification; model outputs remain advisory. |

The [native requirements](spec.kvx) and [traceability](traceability.md) define the complete public implementation contract. Private planning records are not build, validation or publication dependencies.

## 2. Recommended design decisions

These are proposed defaults to review with the pack. Changing one requires updating affected contracts, tasks and tests rather than silently weakening implementation.

| ID | Proposed decision | Reason and boundary |
|---|---|---|
| D-01 | Stable feature/domain accountability with successive wave packages; support explicit wave-manager transfers. | Findings remain attributable after the original wave ends. Manager process lifetime and engineering responsibility are distinct. |
| D-02 | Extend main-server execution exclusion to preparation, indexing, tests, reproduction, review execution and integration. | Preserve the supervisory failure/resource boundary. Source inspection and published state/context reads remain allowed. |
| D-03 | TypeScript control/provisioning/dispatch services with official pinned provider SDKs; retain useful C CLI/indexing/supervisor functionality. | Makes provider integration concrete while avoiding a wholesale rewrite. Service and native interfaces require explicit versioning and integration owners. |
| D-04 | PostgreSQL, artifacts and Git outside the main server's failure domain. | Main failure must not erase acknowledged state. This does not provide uninterrupted leader availability. |
| D-05 | Primary-only authority, synchronous eligible-standby durability and qualified old-primary/control-writer fencing. | Prevent acknowledged ownership from disappearing on the qualified single-primary failure path. Exact hosting/HA mechanism remains O-03. |
| D-06 | Replica reads require appropriate freshness and a consistent packet snapshot; use bounded fallback to primary. | A recent graph combined with stale spec/dependency state is not a valid task packet. Replicas cannot grant ownership. |
| D-07 | Split worker compute authority, immutable submission custody, verification-job leases and integration publication authority. | Coding resources can be released while independent review proceeds; expiry must not discard valid admitted work. |
| D-08 | Committed pending-delivery outbox, transactional inbox deduplication and revision checks. | Database sequence allocation is not commit order. Network delivery is at least once; accepted effects are idempotent, not a claim of exactly-once physical execution. |
| D-09 | Central immutable graph generations, remote extraction, bounded bulk staging and atomic publication. | Shared graph scale cannot be achieved by sending every existing SQLite per-row query over a network. Search/FTS parity remains an acceptance requirement. |
| D-10 | Common provider capability contract; fresh supervisor enrollment is baseline. | Preserve Railway disk-only restore and Blaxel lifecycle differences. Preview memory snapshots are optional and disabled unless safe pre-execution identity renewal is proven. |
| D-11 | Explicit isolated worker slots with resource reservations for children, builds, tests, review and indexing. | Two agents per sandbox is a qualified profile, not a universal constant; separate worktrees alone are not credential isolation. |
| D-12 | Independent remote qualification, producer/consumer semantic tests and revision-bound review receipts. | Existing status, proof strings and process exits cannot establish system correctness. Model scores cannot certify completion. |
| D-13 | Canonical internal findings with GitHub as external input/mirror; event routing supplements ten-minute reconciliation. | GitHub delays or duplicated events cannot create duplicate repair ownership or lose accountability. |
| D-14 | Remote protected-ref gateway with sole publication rights, expected-head CAS and unknown-outcome reconciliation. | PostgreSQL fences cannot stop a process holding unrestricted Git credentials. Host/ref enforcement must be qualified. |
| D-15 | Multi-repository candidate manifest and release barrier with explicit partial-publication recovery. | Separate Git refs cannot be updated atomically across repositories by ordinary Git operations. Consumers use the released manifest. |
| D-16 | Asynchronous typed Span/Jev/D1 advice, mandatory context preservation, calibrated abstention and bounded deterministic fallback. | Model outages cannot stop fleet authority/control. No winner is selected before Hyperfide-specific evaluation. |
| D-17 | Single-authority migration with read-only source inventory, shadow parity, quiescent cutover and explicit rollback boundary. | Dual active SQLite/PostgreSQL ownership would create split authority. Imported historical done labels remain historical unless evidenced. |
| D-18 | Public command `hyperfide`, legacy `cg` compatibility; proposed release 2.0.0. | Latest name is settled; exact release numbering, published package/domain/editor identities and compatibility duration need a recorded release decision. No short alias or namespace ownership is assumed. |
| D-19 | Initial 60 Railway / 40 Blaxel illustrative allocation, five prepared replacements, 200 remote agents plus main sessions. | Demonstrates counts and role placement only. Provider split, slot density and exact manager count are adjustable from qualification. |
| D-20 | Staged deterministic checks, live canaries, then real 48/72-hour mixed-workload campaigns. | Simulation and CRUD smoke tests cannot establish long-running native agent, credential, provider or semantic correctness. |

The native spec and detailed contracts include operational safeguards even though legacy Codify defaults are advisory. The user explicitly requested proper fleet coordination and verification; proposals enforce ownership and qualification invariants rather than applying unrelated warning-only policy to authoritative state. New optional policy restrictions outside these contracts remain reviewable rather than silently imposed.

## 3. Open qualification and decision gates

An OPEN item is not assumed resolved by this pack. Each has an owner/workstream and a defined point where evidence is required. Unrelated implementation may proceed after overall approval; a dependent live deployment or claim may not.

| ID | Unresolved item | Resolution evidence / gate | Native task owners |
|---|---|---|---|
| O-01 | Account-session, API-credential or mixed native authentication; actual model alias resolution and licensed access. | **DECIDED:** the authentication mode and model alias resolution are those configured for the Paxeer X v6.12.0 production release run that qualifies task 27.3; that run records the selected modes and their renewal evidence. Document selected modes using approved credentials; standalone auth probes, safe refresh concurrency, pinned connector launch/resume, actual allowed model identity and 72-hour operation. No copied arbitrary host auth directories. Gate each native route before live use. | 14.3, 13.1–13.4, 27.3 |
| O-02 | Actual Railway/Blaxel account limits, topology, regions, resource classes, create rates, network paths and lifecycle ceilings. | **DECIDED:** the account limits, topology and regions are those configured for the Paxeer X v6.12.0 production release run that qualifies task 27.3; observed limits are recorded from that run. Account-scoped capability records and disposable live provider tests; configured entitlement remains unverified until checked. Gate provider expansion, not all storage development. | 8.2, 8.4, 9.4, 10.4, 27.3 |
| O-03 | PostgreSQL major version, driver/pooler, hosting, synchronous standby, fencing and backup configuration. | Pin supported versions; migration/primary-loss/old-primary-isolation/PITR drills, measured WAL/latency and documented durability guarantees. Gate authority deployment. | 4.1–4.4, 24.4 |
| O-04 | Git host, target ref ACL/server hook or equivalent gateway enforcement; permissions across participating repositories. | Prove direct stale worker/old-gateway target writes fail, reconcile lost response/in-flight requests, and demonstrate multi-repository partial recovery. Gate accepted publication. | 14.4, 19.2, 19.3 |
| O-05 | Artifact store, data retention/deletion policy, project separation, secret broker/injection and approved model egress. | Hash/receipt, ACL, redaction/rotation, retention/restore and failure tests against selected services. Gate durable evidence and external source transfer. | 14.1–14.4, 15.2, 15.4, 24.4 |
| O-06 | Exact per-profile resources, slot density, build/index/review budgets and sustained-concurrency measurement window. | Freeze named load manifests; measure real active sessions versus waiting/idle, steady-state and fault intervals, resource use and useful qualified work. Gate the 100/200 capacity claim. **OPEN**, measured from the Paxeer X v6.12.0 production release run (task 27.3). | 5.4, 12.1, 23.1–23.4, 27.2–27.4 |
| O-07 | Actual source/graph corpus and comparative latency/throughput baselines. | Pin real repositories separately from large spec fixtures; record query/edit/write mix, batching, connection/lock pressure, search parity and baseline comparison. Gate speedup claims. | 7.1–7.4, 27.2 |
| O-08 | Model route entitlement, version stability, exact billing/context/media semantics, tail latency and decision quality. | Route tests, actual usage reconciliation, held-out temporally valid labels, calibration/abstention and controlled trials. Gate recommendation-policy promotion; core loop remains available without advice. | 20.1–20.4, 22.1–22.4 |
| O-09 | RPO/RTO, minimum HA topology, retention horizons, latency thresholds and endurance settings. | Initial engineering targets are proposals in storage/verification; freeze accepted campaign settings before execution. Failure cannot be retroactively passed by reducing the target. **OPEN**, measured from the Paxeer X v6.12.0 production release run (task 27.3). | 4.4, 23.2, 24.4, 27.3 |
| O-10 | Public release version, package/editor/plugin/domain namespaces and legacy compatibility duration. | Record release decision and namespace ownership before publishing; preserve real historical identifiers. Gate distribution, not use of Hyperfide in this draft. | 26.1–26.4, 28.3 |
| O-11 | Whether to adopt specialist-sharded review or other coverage reductions. | Default is already defined: every configured watcher reviews every relevant commit. An alternative requires explicit policy acceptance and changed coverage tests. No answer is required to implement the default. | 17.1 |
| O-12 | Optional self-host Span and preview provider capabilities. | Compatible remote hardware, pinned artifacts/licensing, pre-resume identity safety and equivalent route/lifecycle qualification. Excluded from production baseline if unqualified; no hidden dependency on a preview. | 20.3, 22.3, 9.4, 10.4 |

These gates do not request new permissions during specification authoring. Provider/model campaigns and production changes must use the scope authorised when that work is reached. Routine actions already within the approved run policy must not introduce repeated human confirmation.

## Approved run-policy exceptions

A recorded exception narrows where one named verification leg executes; it does not waive the leg, relax its assertions or change any other remote-execution obligation.

| ID | Exception | Scope and conditions | Native task owners |
|---|---|---|---|
| E-01 | The task 2.1 private-corpus qualification leg (`--qualify-private-corpus`) runs on the supervisory host where the private corpus lives. | Only that leg; the public V-001 and V-024 component legs run on the fleet. The corpus, descriptor and private receipts stay in ignored storage on the supervisory host and are never transferred to fleet workers or copied into public metadata. | 2.1 |

## 4. Explicit dispositions

- **ObjectBox:** assessed rather than ignored. Its strongly consistent server cluster is acknowledged; eventual local-client claim synchronization is not the selected authority design. PostgreSQL matches the selected architecture. No comparative benchmark supports a blanket performance rejection.
- **Cheap coding workers:** superseded by the later frontier-only instruction. Decision models assist bounded judgement; they do not perform implementation work in place of the configured frontier agents.
- **SQLite:** distributed fleet/graph authority migrates to PostgreSQL. Existing local/offline functionality and optional caches may continue with explicitly separate authority; no silent fleet write-back from offline state.
- **Always-on availability:** one supervisory main server is an acknowledged supervision failure domain. Durable recovery and bounded worker continuation are mandatory; continuous leadership failover is not falsely promised.
- **Full memory cloning:** optional, not production foundation. Disk/image preparation and fresh identity are the common provider baseline.
- **Approval and proof:** spec review does not activate a run; a task labelled done does not prove correctness; a source/doc review does not qualify an account, model or deployment.

## Approved bootstrap authoring policy

The programme owner authorised implementation on 2026-10-16. The native specification records that approval and owns live bootstrap task progress until the qualified PostgreSQL authority takes over. The planning catalog and dated authoring reports retain their historical meaning. Explicit scope amendments are coordinated in both native and catalog structure without copying historical pending states over live work.

The workflow temporarily disables Markdown mirrors because the reviewed public requirements index is manually maintained. Generated agent pointers still come from the owning workflow source. Permanent generated-document ownership and naming remain task26.4; public CLI and MCP integration remain task25.3.

The internal native component dispatcher is a trusted local build/invocation seam. It does not grant programme approval, leases, provider credentials or protected-branch authority. Authority-changing operations must be admitted through the corresponding qualified control boundary.

## Approved runtime integration amendments

The amended planning catalog retains 112 tasks and 56 canonical cases and now orders implementation across 26 waves. Task 27.1 and task 1.4 retain waves 1 and 2; their live statuses and every canonical case record are preserved. The additional wave follows explicit runtime composition, network admission, native transport and distribution dependencies. These amendments assign implementation ownership within the existing approved requirements and do not certify future behavior.

| Owner | Integration obligation | Required predecessor and handoff |
|---|---|---|
| 4.2 | Per-process bounded PostgreSQL resources, component dependency capabilities and deterministic shutdown; multiple components share the initialized resource container. | Registry ownership follows 1.4; separate service roles continue to communicate through durable channels rather than share cross-process globals. |
| 14.1 | Authenticated persistent HTTPS coordinator, external versioned envelope, trusted invocation identity and readiness/shutdown lifecycle. | Follows 4.2 resources and 1.4 service runtime; takes registry from 4.2 and service lifecycle from 1.4. Remote payloads cannot replace policy or trusted actor context. |
| 12.1 | Native HTTPS transport using libcurl and a qualified TLS backend, enrollment/heartbeat/reconnect and actual slot registration. | Follows 14.1; takes Makefile, native fragment schema and build helper from 1.4 before adding transport source/header/link declarations. Certificate and hostname verification remain enforced. |
| 25.3 | Link nested registered native modules into actual public CLI/MCP, reuse native HTTPS transport and exercise real public entrypoints. | Follows 12.1 transport and 14.1 protocol; takes Makefile from 12.1 and standalone dispatch/ABI sources from 1.4, preserving separate main functions. |
| 26.2 | Produce and install the canonical executable and compatibility entrypoint, update release/uninstall paths, preserve transport/runtime link dependencies. | Takes Makefile from 25.3 and installer/release scripts from 26.1. Tests clean builds and disposable-prefix installation/uninstallation; production publication remains separately authorised. |

The versioned catalog records every exact shared-path ownership chain and the DAG enforces the handoffs. Current foundation JSONL dispatch and the internal native component seam remain bounded foundation work; neither substitutes for the later coordinator listener, authenticated native registration or public client integration. Ignored generated AGENTS/CLAUDE pointers are regenerated from their owning source and are excluded from task 1.4 tracked commit paths.

The task1.4 qualification attempt exposed an ordering-only checker defect for a file beside a directory with the same prefix. Task1.4 takes the checker path after task27.1, uses the runner's canonical string ordering, and verifies both matching inventories and changed-content refusal. Rejected receipts remain immutable.
