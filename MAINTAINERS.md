# Maintainers

This file lists the people responsible for Hyperfide (released as Codify through 1.x), what they own, and how maintainership works. It is the authoritative record; if GitHub permissions and this file ever disagree, this file wins and permissions get corrected.

## Current maintainers

| Name | GitHub | Role | Areas |
|---|---|---|---|
| Andrew | @sidiora-labs | Lead maintainer, architect | Everything; final say on architecture, releases, and the kvx spec format |

## What maintainers do

- Review and merge pull requests
- Triage issues and label them honestly, including closing ones that will not be worked on
- Cut releases and write release notes; nothing in the 2.0.0-dev tree is a release until an approved release is cut
- Handle security reports per [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)
- Enforce the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- Keep `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/hyperfide/operations.md` truthful as the code evolves
- Keep task `status` lines in `spec/hyperfide/spec.kvx` backed by the evidence under `artifacts/hyperfide/tasks/`

## Decision making

Day-to-day decisions are made in issues and pull requests by whoever is doing the work, subject to review. Anything that changes an external contract gets extra scrutiny before merge:

- CLI flags and output formats, for both `hyperfide` and the deprecated `cg` compatibility alias, which must keep identical arguments, JSON and exit codes for the compatibility window of the approved release
- The `--json` schemas
- MCP tool names and shapes, and the `hyperfide://` and legacy `codify://` resource schemes
- Configuration names: `codify.kvx` and its planned `hyperfide.kvx` successor, and the legacy `CG_*` and `CODIFY_*` environment aliases
- The kvx grammar and spec render output (locked to golden files)
- The snapshot object format
- The control-service protocol and PostgreSQL migrations under `services/hyperfide/migrations/`
- The qualification harness: the case registry, registrations and manifests under `tests/hyperfide/`

Disagreements are resolved by discussion first. If discussion stalls, the lead maintainer decides. Decisions are recorded in the relevant issue so they do not have to be re-argued from memory.

## Becoming a maintainer

There is no application form. Maintainers are invited after a track record of:

- Several merged contributions of real substance, not just typo fixes
- Review comments on other people's PRs that demonstrate understanding of the codebase
- Reliability: doing what you said you would do, on roughly the timeline you said

If that describes you, an existing maintainer will likely reach out. You can also express interest at maintainers@sidiora.com.

## Stepping down

Maintainers can step down at any time by updating this file. Life happens, and a clean handoff is worth far more than a lingering absent name. Maintainers inactive for 12 months will be moved to emeritus status after a check-in.

## Emeritus
