/* Codify fleet view — the agent hierarchy, live, in the sidebar.
 *
 * A fleet is a tree: Main Gideon owns the main branch, a wave manager owns
 * each wave's wave/<feature>/<n>, and a task worker owns each task's
 * task/<feature>/<id>, each in its own worktree. (A workflow whose templates
 * name neither {wave} nor {task} keeps the older shape: one feature manager
 * on feature/<name>, wave workers on wave/<feature>/<n>.) `cg fleet tree` reports that hierarchy directly and is preferred
 * wherever it speaks; what it does not cover — the waves nobody has started,
 * the tasks in each one, and whether a branch is already in its base — is
 * joined from the agents registry (cg fleet status), the live claims (cg spec
 * status), the plan (cg fleet plan) and the branch registry (cg branches). On
 * a cg too old to have a tree, that join carries the whole view on its own.
 * fleetTree() does all of it and is pure and vscode-free on purpose: the join
 * is where the interesting mistakes are, and a shell can test it.
 *
 * Two deliberate refusals:
 *
 *   - a refresh never runs `cg fleet pr`, because that command *opens* a pull
 *     request. Open PRs are shown from what an explicit action reported, never
 *     discovered by polling.
 *   - merge state is only what the registry can prove: equal heads mean the
 *     base already contains the branch. The view never invents a commit count
 *     it has not been given.
 *
 * Every cg call goes through the extension's single refresh scheduler and is
 * raced against a timeout, so the view cannot sit on a spinner forever.
 *
 * Plain JS, zero dependencies, no build step. */
